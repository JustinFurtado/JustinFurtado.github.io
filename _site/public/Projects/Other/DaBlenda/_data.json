                             "I remember the whole plot of the story. We wrote 40 pages of content that we wanted in our game. I remember how it started and developed. I remember meeting up with the whole team of friends every Saturday for years to talk about this game we wanted to make. I remember getting and losing team members, I remember just how invested I was in making this game. I remember that I found the time to read 7 books on programming. All before college, because I wanted to learn. I remember doing every programming exercise in the books to learn as much as I could. I remember starting over on the game more than once. I remember watching free programming tutorial videos on the internet. I remember being proud of this game. Of every feature we added. I remember all the placeholder content, our funniest bugs, our plans for it, our hopes and dreams.",
                             "This is the game I remember in terms of what we wanted it to be rather than what it was. This is the game I think of in terms of content rather than in terms of technology. If you want to know about the technology, well, we used XNA and Visual Basic at first, and then started re-writing it in C# with XNA. We gave up when we realized we weren't going to finish before we all moved to different states for college. At it's largest, it had around 20,000 lines of code, 12,000 for the game and 8,000 for the map editor. We were self-taught, so those lines are probably not the highest quality lines and could have been refactored massively. We realized this, hence the partial re-write.",
                             "This game may never be finished, but it is full of nostalgia and learning experiences for me. I remember learning pathfinding, fixing bugs where enemy movement speeds were accidentally set to zero, figuring out what recursion is by accident after our first 'stack overflow.'",
                             "But more than that I learned that I want to make games. I learned I could have so much fun designing and programming games, even if game sound effects and art assets aren't my strongsuit. It is because of this, because working on this game was the most passionate I've ever been about anything at all ever, that I know in my mind I am destined to be a game developer. If it weren't for this project, I'd be miserable at some other college. Instead, I'm happily preparing myself for my dream job while maintaining a 4.0 working with software development - where I'm happiest.",
                             "Most of the art assets are placeholder. We planned to replace them all. I believe our placeholder assets originated from OpenGameArt.org. We do not claim them as our own. They would not have been shipped with the game if we had finished it. The sound assets (cannot be seen) were actually made by a member of the team with some serious musical talent. Go him.",
                             "We implemented many features that can't be shown effectively here, such as procedural battle map generation, a full-fledged map editor, more weather particle effects, multiple difficulties, a credits screen and much more."],
