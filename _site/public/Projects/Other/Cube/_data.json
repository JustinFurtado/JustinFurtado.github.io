Their names are Kyle St. Amant and Wesley Sheng. A link to Wesley's site can be found at the bottom of this page, and Kyle did not provide me with a link to his site.",
                             "This game was made using Unity, and features several levels: blue, green, orange, red, yellow. Face the dreaded boss, Cone, during level Red, and earn bonus points in the special yellow challenge level. Reach the goal of each level within the time limit to win.",
                             "The game, despite its simplicity, does show that I can work under tough time conditions with other developers to produce something fun."]
