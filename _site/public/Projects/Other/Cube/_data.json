Their names are Kyle St. Amant and Wesley Sheng. A link to each of their sites can be found at the bottom of the page.",
                             "This game was made using Unity, and features several levels: blue, green, orange, red, yellow. Face the dreaded boss, Cone, during level Red, and earn bonus points in the special yellow challenge level. Reach the goal of each level within the time limit to win.",
