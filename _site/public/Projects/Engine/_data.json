                             "Passing data around the engine in new ways and toying with the OpenGL state allowed me to draw 3D shapes in my engine!", 
                             "At this point, framerate-dependent movement was starting to become a noticable issue with window resizing, so it was time to get the system time and calculate the delta times to pass around for framerate-independent object motion. It was also useful for calculating FPS.",

                             "Simple bounding box/bounding sphere collisions with the camera and object allow me to finally make a simple game in my engine! It is very simple. Find the house in the giant box of shapes to win. [Cannot be run in-browser, contact me if interested in seeing]", 
                             "Oh finally, not having to type vertices by hand to render shapes on the screen! I manually parse data from .obj files to get any shape in my engine and demo it with several models!", 
                             "With model loading then comes the desire to load textured models. Passing around some UV data, loading textures into OpenGL and writing more GLSL shaders allows for much better-looking models!",

                             "The ability to check if a ray touches a triangle is a very handy thing to have into a game. It can be seen in this assignment by firing red blocks that stick to the walls.",
