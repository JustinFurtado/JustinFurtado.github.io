Project showcase is a Neumont event where students present things they've worked on and audience members (students, visitors, etc.) and faculty vote on their favorite projects. Gemetary won when I entered it.",

                             "Finally, perhaps the biggest honor so far is being invited to present at the Neumont Capstone Invitational ceremony. This is an event exclusive to the few top students whose capstone projects shine above the rest. Due to the technical depth and potential usefulness of my capstone, I was invited to present my project live in front of a large audience at the library."],

I earned several other awards too including AP Scholar with Honor for my advanced placement test scores, as well as multiple for maintaining a 4.0+ GPA throughout all of high school.
