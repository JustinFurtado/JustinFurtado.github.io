That game is Gemetary. It is a 3D infinite maze game, inspired by Pacman. Collect gems, blow up walls, avoid and defeat enemies by scaring them with powerful lanterns. The maze is near-infinite, meaning that while it does have an end, that end is generated far enough out that is is virtually impossible to reach without cheating. Each enemy uses a unique AI (depth-first, path following, AStar), there is difficulty scaling and local high score competition. Feel free to change the options, enjoy the attention to detail (did someone say mouse-hover sound effects for buttons?), look for secret mechanics, or just appreciate that you get a different maze every time you play."})

What you see here is NOT my capstone. It is a demonstration of what can be done with my capstone by exporting the models generated with my capstone into Unity. My actual capstone is a standalone application written in C++, using DirectX and the Windows API. In this demonstration you can see how my capstone could be useful by clicking the 'boringify' button, which could be renamed 'what it would look like without my capstone', and the 'regenerate' button, which could be renamed 'see what it would look like with every model varied using my capstone.'"})

I chose Unity, having enjoyed using it in previous courses. For the project, I made a game where the mechanic is simple, yet expandable.

With a focus on fun gameplay rather than pretty assets, my team member (Trent Castro) and I made a game in which the goal is to push the other player off the edge. It can be very, very competitive and chaotic as four different power-ups spawn faster and faster to increase tension for players and give them new ways to trick the other player off the edge!"})

I did this through adding visual and sound effects to keep it interesting. I added particles, changed the music, made the background scroll, added screen-shake, made the score scale and count up, and much more - all in one week!"})
