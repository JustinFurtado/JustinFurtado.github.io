    p.m-3.text-justify Hello, I'm a game developer. I've been making games for fun since high school, and since then for college.
    p.m-3.text-justify I have experience programming in C#, C++, JavaScript, Python and Java. I have experience using Unity, and also making my own game engine with OpenGL. My capstone project made use of DirectX. I have written several shaders in both GLSL and HLSL. I have some exposure to HTML and CSS. For source control I have experience with git. I consider myself good at linear algebra (working with vectors and matrices is important to game development). I have used Maya for two 3D modeling courses.
