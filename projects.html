That game is Gemetary. It is a 3D infinite maze game, inspired by Pacman. Collect gems, blow up walls, avoid and defeat enemies by scaring them with powerful lanterns. The maze is near-infinite, meaning that while it does have an end, that end is generated far enough out that is is virtually impossible to reach without cheating. Each enemy uses a unique AI (depth-first, path following, AStar), there is difficulty scaling and local high score competition. Feel free to change the options, enjoy the attention to detail (did someone say mouse-hover sound effects for buttons?), look for secret mechanics, or just appreciate that you get a different maze every time you play.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col text-center card m-2"><a href="Projects/CapstoneDemo/index.html" class="inline_block"> <h3>Capstone Demo </h3><br><img src="images/CapstoneDemoForest.png" class="img-fluid"></a><br><p class="text-justify">For my capstone project, a 10-week intense course at Neumont requiring us to make something of significant technical depth, I created a 3D mesh generation tool that allows users to generate variants of any 3D mesh based on custom criteria. What you see here is NOT my capstone. It is a demonstration of what can be done with my capstone by exporting the models generated with my capstone into Unity. My actual capstone is a standalone application written in C++, using DirectX and the Windows API. In this demonstration you can see how my capstone could be useful by clicking the 'boringify' button, which could be renamed 'what it would look like without my capstone', and the 'regenerate' button, which could be renamed 'see what it would look like with every model varied using my capstone.'</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col text-center card m-2"><a href="Projects/GearGolf/index.html" class="inline_block"> <h3>Gear Golf </h3><br><img src="images/GearGolf.png" class="img-fluid"></a><br><p class="text-justify">For the Advanced Game Physics course, which, after having us implement physics in our own engines, allowed us an open-ended final project for which we could make a physics-based game using any engine we desire. I chose Unity, having enjoyed using it in previous courses. For the project, I made a game where the mechanic is simple, yet expandable. Click to interact with the environment, get the ball to the goal as quick as possible.</p></div><div class="col text-center card m-2"><a href="Projects/GeometryShooter/index.html" class="inline_block"> <h3>Geometry Shooter </h3><br><img src="images/GeometryShooter.png" class="img-fluid"></a><br><p class="text-justify">Made as a project for the Mobile Game Development course, or, as it should be named 'Intro to Unity', I created a simple block-knocking-over game as my first Unity project of significant depth. It contains four levels, each with a unique mechanic. The goal is simple: Knock over the gold cubes with your limited number of shots</p></div></div><div class="row">   <div class="col text-center card m-2"><a href="Projects/TwoPlayerGame/index.html" class="inline_block"> <h3>Sumo Game </h3><br><img src="images/SumoGame.png" class="img-fluid"></a><br><p class="text-justify">Made as another one-week assignment for the Game Engine Projects course, we were told to make a multiplayer game. With a focus on fun gameplay rather than pretty assets, my team member (Trent Castro) and I made a game in which the goal is to push the other player off the edge. It can be very, very competitive and chaotic as four different power-ups spawn faster and faster to increase tension for players and give them new ways to trick the other player off the edge!</p></div><div class="col text-center card m-2"><a href="Projects/Blocks/index.html" class="inline_block"> <h3>Blocks </h3><br><img src="images/Blocks.png" class="img-fluid"></a><br><p class="text-justify">As an one-week duration assignment for the Game Engine Projects course, we were given a block breaker game and told to, without altering the gameplay, make it more fun. I did this through adding visual and sound effects to keep it interesting. I added particles, changed the music, made the background scroll, added screen-shake, made the score scale and count up, and much more - all in one week!</p></div></div></div></div><div class="m-5"><h2 class="text-center">Engine Projects</h2><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col text-center card m-2"><a href="Projects/Engine/gamelibraries.html" class="inline_block"> <h3>Game Libraries Engine (Q4) </h3><br><img src="images/Engine/GameLibraries/DestructibleTerrain.png" class="img-fluid"></a><br><p class="text-justify">Slideshow of screenshots from the initial version of my game engine!
