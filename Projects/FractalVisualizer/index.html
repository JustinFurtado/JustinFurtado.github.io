                    <h1>Fractal Visualizer</h1>
                    <p>Here we have a video of a project I made for the Game Engine Projects course.</p>
                    <p>For this course, the teacher gave us several one-week duration assignments.</p>
                    <p>One of my favorites from this course, is the expansion of a Fractal Shader I wrote in HLSL, using Unity to pass it inputs based on the output of an audio analyzer, causing the fractal pattern to animate to the beat of the played background music.</p>
                    <p>Due to the graphic-intensive nature of the shader, it is not optimally demonstrated in a broswer. Therefore I have a short video recording below.</p>
                    <p>TODO: Find way to add video here... works locally with video tag... git would not let me push it due to file size.</p>
