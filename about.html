I've been making games for fun since high school, and since then for college. I'm currently in my senior year of college. I'm attending Neumont College of Computer Science, studying in the Bachelor of Science in Software and Game Development degree. I'll be graduating in August of 2018.</p><p class="m-3 text-justify">I have experience programming in C#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Java and Visual Basic. I have experience using Unity, and also making my own game engine with OpenGL. My capstone project made use of DirectX. I have written several shaders in both GLSL and HLSL. I have some exposure to HTML and CSS (this site, a couple web courses). For source control I have experience with git. I consider myself good at linear algebra (working with vectors and matrices is important to game development). I have used Maya for two 3D modeling courses I took as electives.</p><p class="m-3 text-justify">Below you can find some of my academic accomplishments, if you are interested in that. First you will find things I achieved in college, and below that you will find things I achieved way back in high school. I know they are not the most recent things I have done, but they do show that I have been a hard-worker and an achiever for longer than just college.</p><p class="m-3 text-justify">Also <a href="./projects.html">take a look at projects I've completed.</a></p></div><div class="project-group p-3 m-5"><h1 class="text-center m-4 p-3 font-weight-bold">Neumont Awards/Honors</h1><div class="m-4"><div data-ride="carousel" id="slideshow1" data-interval="2500" data-pause="hover" style="height: 700px; background-color: #000000" class="carousel slide"><ol class="carousel-indicators"><li data-target="#slideshow1" data-slide-to="0" class="active"></li><li data-target="#slideshow1" data-slide-to="1"></li><li data-target="#slideshow1" data-slide-to="2"></li><li data-target="#slideshow1" data-slide-to="3"></li><li data-target="#slideshow1" data-slide-to="4"></li></ol><div role="listbox" class="carousel-inner"><div class="carousel-item active"><img src="./images/MainPage/Accomplishments/Neumont/invitational_award_small.jpg" style="height: 700px" class="img-fluid d-block w-100"><div style="background-color: #44444499" class="carousel-caption p-4"><h5 class="font-weight-bold">Capstone Invitational Award</h5><p>I was invited to the capstone invitational to present my capstone project, an honor given to only some of the best capstone students at Neumont each year.</p></div></div><div class="carousel-item"><img src="./images/MainPage/Accomplishments/Neumont/showcase_winner_small.jpg" style="height: 700px" class="img-fluid d-block w-100"><div style="background-color: #44444499" class="carousel-caption p-4"><h5 class="font-weight-bold">Project Showcase Overall Audience Favorite</h5><p>Gemetary wins a Neumont project showcase competition across all categories.</p></div></div><div class="carousel-item"><img src="./images/MainPage/Accomplishments/Neumont/half_degree_small.jpg" style="height: 700px" class="img-fluid d-block w-100"><div style="background-color: #44444499" class="carousel-caption p-4"><h5 class="font-weight-bold">My Half-Diploma</h5><p>This simply shows that I am in college, that I am over halfway done, that I am in the game degree.

Project showcase is a Neumont event where students present things they've worked on and audience members (students, visitors, etc.) and faculty vote on their favorite projects. Gemetary won when I entered it.</p><p class="m-3 text-justify">Another is my half-diploma. I include this not because its amazingly impressive or anything, but simply to show that I am already over halfway through my degree in software and game development. I was proud to receive this. I will get my full degree in August 2018.</p><p class="m-3 text-justify">Finally, perhaps the biggest honor so far is being invited to present at the Neumont Capstone Invitational ceremony. This is an event exclusive to the few top students whose capstone projects shine above the rest. Due to the technical depth and potential usefulness of my capstone, I was invited to present my project live in front of a large audience at the library.</p></div><div class="project-group p-3 m-5"><h1 class="text-center m-4 p-3 font-weight-bold">Concord High School Awards/Honors</h1><div class="m-4"><div data-ride="carousel" id="slideshow2" data-interval="2500" data-pause="hover" style="height: 700px; background-color: #000000" class="carousel slide"><ol class="carousel-indicators"><li data-target="#slideshow2" data-slide-to="0" class="active"></li><li data-target="#slideshow2" data-slide-to="1"></li><li data-target="#slideshow2" data-slide-to="2"></li><li data-target="#slideshow2" data-slide-to="3"></li><li data-target="#slideshow2" data-slide-to="4"></li></ol><div role="listbox" class="carousel-inner"><div class="carousel-item active"><img src="./images/MainPage/Accomplishments/CHS/attendance_combined.jpg" style="height: 700px" class="img-fluid d-block w-100"><div style="background-color: #44444499" class="carousel-caption p-4"><h5 class="font-weight-bold">Perfect Attendance</h5><p>I had perfect attendance for 3/4 years in high school. I think that while some people would say this isn't worth posting because it just shows I 'showed up' I disagree. I think it speaks to my work-ethic to say that I never ditched, and only missed due to illness once in four years.</p></div></div><div class="carousel-item"><img src="./images/MainPage/Accomplishments/CHS/class_combined.jpg" style="height: 700px" class="img-fluid d-block w-100"><div style="background-color: #44444499" class="carousel-caption p-4"><h5 class="font-weight-bold">Class Awards</h5><p>Here we have the awards I received that were specific to a class in high school. I like to point out that I got a math award for all 4 math courses I took in high school, and a computer award. I think it speaks to my math/logic mind and skills. I also had a few other awards like spanish, physics and history.</p></div></div><div class="carousel-item"><img src="./images/MainPage/Accomplishments/CHS/general_combined.jpg" style="height: 700px" class="img-fluid d-block w-100"><div style="background-color: #44444499" class="carousel-caption p-4"><h5 class="font-weight-bold">General Awards</h5><p>Here we have some general awards I received that were both not for attendance and not for a specific course.

I had perfect attendance 3/4 years, which speaks to my dedication to education. I earned 9 class-specific awards including 4 math class awards, 1 computer class award, 1 physics class award, 1 history class award and 2 spanish class awards. I earned several other awards too including AP Scholar with Honor for my advanced placement test scores, as well as multiple for maintaining a 4.0+ GPA throughout all of high school. Finally I received special recognition for my performance in a computer applications course, being nominated for an award by my teacher and getting to give a speech about the course and how I found it valuable.</p></div><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/css/Bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script></div></div></body></html>
